🎯 The Problem We Solve

Every development team faces the same frustrations:
The Cost Problem

    💸 AI APIs are expensive — ChatGPT/Claude costs add up fast for teams
    📈 Usage is unpredictable — One big project can blow your budget
    🔒 Vendor lock-in — Switching providers means rewriting code

The Security Problem

    🔑 Secrets leak constantly — API keys in commits, logs, and config files
    📝 Security docs are neglected — SECURITY.md files don't exist until after a breach
    🕵️ No visibility — You don't know what's being sent to AI services

The Quality Problem

    🧪 Writing tests is tedious — Developers skip them due to time pressure
    🌳 Project structure becomes messy — No one documents the architecture
    ❓ Web sources are unreliable — Can't trust what you find online

The Automation Problem

    🤖 Repetitive tasks waste time — Humans do work that could be automated
    🔄 Tools don't talk to each other — Every tool is its own silo
    💥 AI agents fail without fallbacks — When they break, everything stops

💡 The Solution

The Adaptive Intelligence Platform is a modular, on-premise automation system that gives you:
✅ Cost Control

Run AI locally with automatic failover to expensive cloud APIs only when needed. Cut costs by 70%.
✅ Security by Design

Scan for secrets before commit, generate security documentation automatically, and keep all data on-premise.
✅ Quality Automation

Generate comprehensive test suites, verify web sources, and maintain project documentation—all automatically.
✅ Intelligent Orchestration

Deploy autonomous agents that handle routine tasks and escalate to humans only when stuck, learning from each interaction.

  --metadata '{"generated_by": "Chameleon", "date": "2025-10-03"}'

# Verify watermark
embedid verify path/to/file.py

# Check remix lineage
embedid lineage path/to/file.py

# Batch operations
embedid add src/ --recursive --author "MyCompany"

Example Watermark:
python

# File: api.py
# EmbedID: v1.0.0
# Author: James The Giblet
# Generated: 2025-10-03T14:30:00Z

⚙️ AAS (Autonomous Agent System) — The Foundation

The Problem:

    Manual tasks waste developer time
    AI agents fail without recovery
    No resource control leads to runaway processes
    Tools don't learn from mistakes

The Solution: Enterprise-grade agent orchestration platform with human fallback, resource limits, and self-improvement.

Features:

    🤖 Autonomous task execution
    📚 Skill Library (Pantheon) — Git-based skill versioning
    👨‍💻 Human Fallback (Copilot Bridge) — Escalate when stuck
    🎓 Self-Improvement — Learn from human feedback
    🔒 Resource Control — CPU/memory limits per agent
    📊 Monitoring — Prometheus/Grafana integration
    🔐 Security — RBAC, audit logs, sandboxed execution

How It Works:

1. Task Submission:
bash

# Submit task to queue
POST /api/v1/tasks
{
  "type": "security_audit",
  "target": "/path/to/project",
  "priority": "high"
}

2. Agent Processing:

Task Queue → Agent picks up task → Checks Pantheon for skill
→ Downloads skill if needed → Executes in sandbox
→ Logs result → Updates memory

3. Human Fallback (When Agent Fails):

Agent fails → Task flagged for human → Human reviews via UI
→ Human provides solution → Agent learns from feedback
→ Next time, agent handles it autonomously

4. Resource Control:
yaml

# podman-compose.yml
services:
  agent_1:
    resources:
      limits:
        cpus: '0.5'      # Max 50% of 1 CPU
        memory: '512M'    # Max 512MB RAM
    read_only: true       # Filesystem read-only
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true

# Security Posture Report — October 2025

## 🚨 Critical Issues (Action Required)
- **3 repos** contain exposed secrets → [Details](#secrets)
- **12 repos** lack SECURITY.md → [Remediation](#security-docs)

## ⚠️ High Priority
- **8 repos** below 70% test coverage → [Analysis](#coverage)
- **5 repos** have outdated dependencies → [Update Plan](#deps)

## 📊 Overall Health: 7.2/10
- Secrets: 94% clean (3 violations)
- Documentation: 76% complete
- Test Coverage: 73% average
- License Compliance: 100% ✓

## 🎯 Recommended Actions
1. Run Whisper on flagged repos immediately
2. Deploy Aegis to generate security docs (automated)
3. Schedule Test Generator for low-coverage repos
4. Apply dependency updates via dependabot

## 🤖 AI Insights
Based on analysis of 50 repositories, security posture is **good** with 
room for improvement. Primary concern is secret management in legacy repos. 
Recommend implementing pre-commit hooks organization-wide.

🔐 Security
Security Practices

We take security seriously:

Code Security:

    All code reviewed before merge
    Automated security scanning (Whisper dogfooding)
    Dependencies kept up-to-date (dependabot)
    No secrets in code (verified by Whisper)

Infrastructure Security:

    On-premise deployment (your data, your servers)
    Encrypted communications (TLS/SSL)
    Resource isolation (containerized agents)
    Audit logging (immutable records)
    RBAC (role-based access control)

Data Security:

    No data sent to cloud (unless explicitly configured)
    Local processing by default
    Optional encryption at rest
    Configurable data retention

Reporting Vulnerabilities

FAQ
General Questions

Q: Is this really free?
A: Yes, the Community edition is free forever. Open source under MIT license.

Q: Can I use this commercially?
A: Yes! MIT license allows commercial use.

Q: Do I need cloud APIs?
A: No. You can run 100% locally with Ollama. Cloud APIs are optional for better performance.

Q: Is my data secure?
A: Yes. Everything runs on-premise. Data never leaves your infrastructure unless you explicitly configure external APIs.

Q: Can I customize the tools?
A: Absolutely. All code is open source. Fork, modify, extend as needed.
Technical Questions

Q: What's the difference between AAS and Praximous?
A:

    AAS = Agent orchestration layer (manages task distribution, resource control, human fallback)
    Praximous = AI gateway (routes to LLMs, executes Smart Skills)
    Think of it as: AAS is the operating system, Praximous is the AI middleware

Q: Can I run this on Windows?
A: Yes, via WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Native Windows support coming Q1 2026.

Q: Does this work with my existing tools?
A: Yes. Integrations available for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Slack, Jira, etc.

Q: What's a Smart Skill?
A: A modular capability that Praximous can execute. Each tool (Whisper, Aegis, etc.) is available as a Smart Skill.

Q: Can I create custom skills?
A: Yes! See Skill Development Guide.

Q: How does the human fallback work?
A: When an agent can't complete a task, it escalates to the Copilot Bridge. A human reviews via web UI, provides solution, and the agent learns for next time.
Pricing Questions

Q: What happens if I exceed Community limits?
A: You'll get a notification. No service disruption. We'll work with you on upgrade options.

Q: Can I try Enterprise for free?
A: Yes! 30-day trial, no credit card required.

Q: Do you offer refunds?
A: Yes. 30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked.

Q: Can I pay with purchase order?
A: Yes, for Enterprise customers.

Q: Are there setup fees?
A: No setup fees. Ever.

💬 Closing Thoughts
Why This Exists

This platform wasn't built by a massive team with VC funding. It was built by one person who got tired of the same problems breaking his workflow:

    API keys leaking into commits
    Writing the same tests over and over
    Security docs that nobody maintained
    AI that couldn't adapt to his domain
    Tools that didn't talk to each other
    Repetitive tasks that wasted time

So I fixed them.

And then I realized: if these problems frustrate me, they probably frustrate millions of other developers.

This is the platform I wish existed when I started.
The Vision

We believe:

    AI should reduce costs, not inflate them
    Your data should stay on your infrastructure
    Tools should work together, not in silos
    Security should be automated, not neglected
    Quality should be easy, not optional
    Developers should build, not babysit

This platform makes that possible.
Join Us

Whether you're:

    A developer tired of repetitive tasks
    A team lead trying to enforce quality
    A CTO worried about security and costs
    An open source enthusiast who loves to tinker

There's a place for you here.

Star the repo. Try the tools. Join the Discord. Contribute a skill. Share your story.

Let's build the future of developer automation together.
🎯 The Bottom Line

The Adaptive Intelligence Platform gives you:

✅ Cost Control — 70% reduction in AI API costs
✅ Security — Automated scanning, doc generation, audit logs
✅ Quality — Comprehensive tests, verified sources, clean code
✅ Efficiency — Autonomous agents handling routine tasks
✅ Freedom — No vendor lock-in, on-premise deployment, open source

All working together. All under your control.
