🎯 What Is This?
This project is a suite of AI-powered, open-source tools designed for developers. Currently, four of these tools are at an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage and ready for use: Whisper, Aegis, EmbedID, and MarkFlow.
The other tools are in active development. The long-term vision is to unify all of them into a single, cohesive 3-layer system (AAS, Praximous Gateway, and Tools) once each component is MVP-ready.
This project is for: Developers who want to use specific, powerful AI tools today, and who are interested in following the journey toward a fully integrated platform.
⚡ Quick Start: Using an MVP-Ready Tool (Recommended)
The best way to get started is by installing one of the MVP-ready tools directly. For example, here's how to install and use Whisper:
# 1. Install Whisper via pip
pip install adaptive-whisper

# 2. Run a scan on your project
whisper --scan . --output security-report.json

Each MVP-ready tool can be installed and used independently.
🛠️ The Intelligence Tools
✅ MVP Ready
These tools are stable enough for general use. They are the current focus for support and bug fixes.
Whisper — Secret & Vulnerability Scanner
 * 🔍 Secret pattern detection
 * 🛡️ CVE vulnerability scanning
 * 📊 Risk scoring and prioritization
Aegis — Security Compliance Framework
 * 📋 Automated compliance documentation generation
 * ✅ Policy template generation
 * 📈 Foundational reporting dashboards
EmbedID — Code Watermarking & Provenance
 * 🏷️ Invisible code watermarking
 * 📈 Change lineage tracking
 * 🔐 Integrity verification
MarkFlow — Intelligent Markdown Editor
 * ✍️ AI-powered writing assistance
 * 👥 Real-time collaborative editing
 * 📊 Advanced tables and diagrams
🚧 In Active Development
These tools are not yet MVP-ready. You can follow their progress, but expect bugs, missing features, and frequent changes.
 * 🧪 Test Generator — Automated Test Creation
 * 🔍 CertiScope — Web Credibility Scoring
 * 🌳 TreeCraft — Project Structure Analysis
 * 🎭 Chameleon LM — Domain Expertise Adapter
🚀 The Future Vision: A Unified Platform
The ultimate goal is to integrate all tools into a single platform with a powerful AI Gateway and multi-agent system. While this is still under development, you can test a preview of the full system.
Developer Preview: Running the Full Platform
This will run all services, including those still in development.
# 1. Get the platform
git clone https://github.com/adaptive-intelligence/platform.git
cd platform

# 2. Configure (add your API keys)
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 3. Start everything
docker-compose up -d

📈 Roadmap & Vision
This project is in active development. Here's the current plan:
🎯 Current Focus
 * Stabilize MVPs: Continue to refine and fix bugs in Whisper, Aegis, EmbedID, and MarkFlow.
 * Develop Next Tools: Focus on bringing Test Generator, CertiScope, TreeCraft, and Chameleon LM to MVP status.
 * Community Feedback: Listen to feedback on the existing tools to guide development.
🚀 Next Steps
 * Platform Unification: Once all individual tools are at a stable MVP state, the primary focus will shift to integrating them into the unified platform.
 * Gateway Enhancement: Build out the Praximous AI Gateway with more skills and routing logic.
