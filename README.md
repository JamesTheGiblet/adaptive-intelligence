The Adaptive Intelligence Platform
An AI Automation Framework for Developers
> "I built these tools because I was tired of the same problems breaking my workflow. Then I realized I'd accidentally built an entire platform."

🌐 Live Demo | 🚀 Get Started | 🛠️ Tools | 💬 Discord
🎯 What Is This?
The Adaptive Intelligence Platform is a 3-layer AI ecosystem I'm building to bring intelligent automation to software development. All tools are currently in an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage—they work, but expect rough edges.
 * 🤖 AAS (Agent Autonomy System): Multi-agent orchestration for complex workflows.
 * 🚀 Praximous Gateway: An AI router with Smart Skills for common development tasks.
 * 🛠️ Intelligence Tools: 8 specialized tools for security, quality, analysis, and productivity.
This project is for: Fellow developers, tinkerers, and small teams who want to experiment with a powerful, locally-run AI automation stack.
⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)
# 1. Get the platform
git clone https://github.com/adaptive-intelligence/platform.git
cd platform

# 2. Configure (add your API keys)
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Add GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 3. Start everything
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Verify it's working
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/system-status

🎉 You're now running: Praximous Gateway (port 8000), AAS Agents (port 9000), and all Intelligence Tools!
Try it out:
# Scan for secrets
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/process \
  -d '{"task_type": "whisper_scan", "path": "."}'

# Generate tests
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/process \
  -d '{"task_type": "generate_tests", "code": "def add(a,b): return a+b"}'
