### Show HN: I accidentally built 8 AI dev tools (honest assessment inside)

I'm a caretaker who codes at night. Not a professional engineer‚ÄîI just fix problems I have.

**What started as simple tools became a platform:**

Over the past year, I built these to solve my own problems:

- **Whisper** (secret scanner) - I kept pushing API keys to GitHub
- **Aegis** (security docs) - Needed SOC2 compliance, templates sucked
- **Test Generator** - Writing tests is boring, so I automated it
- **CertiScope** - Couldn't trust online sources for research
- **4 others** - Each solving a specific frustration

**What surprised me:** They all work together as a complete platform.

**Current reality check:**

- ‚úÖ **2-3 tools are production-ready** (I use them daily)
- üöß **Rest are working prototypes** (functional but need polish)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **All open source** (MIT), all on-premise
- üïê **One person project** - Issues may take days/weeks

**The platform concept:**

- **Layer 1:** AI Gateway (cut costs 70%, local models + cloud fallback)
- **Layer 2:** Agent orchestration (automate complex workflows)
- **Layer 3:** 8 specialized tools (security, testing, analysis, content)

**What I'm looking for:**

- Is this useful to anyone besides me?
- What problems does this NOT solve?
- Brutally honest feedback about what actually works
- Which tools would you try first?

**Demo:** <https://jamesthegiblet.github.io/adaptive-intelligence/>
**Repo:** <https://github.com/JamesTheGiblet/adaptive-intelligence>

**Fair warning:** This is evenings/weekends work. Some tools are great, others need work. I'm sharing because maybe someone needs this, or maybe I'm delusional about the value. Either way, feedback appreciated.

**Quick try (2 minutes):**

```bash
pip install adaptive-whisper
whisper --scan .  # Find secrets in your code
```

## Follow-up Comments (Be Ready For)

**Q: "Is this just another AI wrapper?"**
A: "Fair question. Some tools are AI-powered (test generation, compliance docs), others are traditional automation (secret scanning, project analysis). The AI gateway reduces costs by routing to local models first. It's more about workflow automation than just AI."

**Q: "How is this different from [existing tool]?"**
A: "Honestly, individual tools might not be revolutionary. The value is having them work together in workflows. Plus being on-premise and open source. But you're right to ask - maybe the individual tools aren't compelling enough."

**Q: "This looks like too much/overwhelming"**
A: "You're absolutely right. That's why I made each tool installable individually. Start with just the secret scanner if that's all you need. The platform concept might be overkill for most people."

**Q: "How do you maintain this alone?"**
A: "I don't, really. I use 2-3 tools daily, so they get attention. The others are more experimental. That's why I'm being upfront about the reality - this isn't a polished product, it's a collection of personal tools that might help others."

**Q: "What's your business model?"**
A: "Nothing right now. These solve my problems. If others find value, maybe consulting or enterprise support eventually. But honestly, I just want to know if I'm building something useful or just elaborate procrastination."

## Reddit r/programming Version

**Title:** "I built 8 development automation tools to solve my own problems - turns out they work together as a platform"

**Content:** [Same as above, but add]

**Why I'm posting here:**
This community gives good technical feedback. I want to know:

- Are these real problems you face?
- Which tools would actually be useful?
- What am I missing that would make this valuable?

I'm not trying to sell anything - just want honest developer feedback on whether this solves real problems or if I've been coding in isolation too long.

## LinkedIn Version

**Title:** "From Personal Frustration to Open Source Platform: 8 AI Development Tools"

**Content:** [More professional tone, emphasize business value]

As a developer working nights after my day job, I kept running into the same problems:

- Secret leaks to GitHub
- Manual security documentation
- Repetitive testing workflows
- Expensive AI API bills

Instead of complaining, I built tools to fix them.

What started as personal utilities evolved into a complete automation platform. Now I'm open-sourcing everything to see if it helps other development teams.

**Key results:**

- 70% reduction in AI costs
- Automated security compliance
- Zero secret leaks in the last 6 months
- Comprehensive test coverage without manual effort

The platform is production-ready for some tools, experimental for others. All feedback welcome from the development community.

[Include professional demo link and GitHub]

## Twitter Thread

**Tweet 1:**
üßµ I accidentally built a development automation platform

Started with a simple secret scanner because I kept pushing API keys to GitHub. One year later: 8 AI-powered tools that work together.

Thread on what I learned üëá

**Tweet 2:**
The problems that drove me to build this:
üí∏ AI APIs cost $5K-50K/month
üîë Secret leaks happen weekly
üìù Security docs don't exist
üß™ Writing tests is boring
‚ùì Can't trust online sources

Sound familiar?

**Tweet 3:**
What I built:

- Whisper: Secret/vulnerability scanner
- Aegis: Auto-generate security docs
- Test Generator: AI-powered test creation
- CertiScope: Web credibility scoring
- 4 others

All open source, all on-premise

**Tweet 4:**
Reality check: I'm one person coding at night. Some tools are production-ready, others are prototypes.

But they solve real problems I had.

Code: [link]

What problems would you automate first?

## Key Success Factors

1. **Be brutally honest** about what works and what doesn't
2. **Set realistic expectations** - one person, evenings/weekends
3. **Ask specific questions** - "What would you try first?" not "What do you think?"
4. **Show the problem first** - lead with pain points, not features
5. **Make it easy to try** - simple pip install, not complex setup
6. **Respond quickly** to early comments - first 2 hours are crucial
7. **Don't oversell** - let the tools speak for themselves

## Launch Timing

**Best:**

- Monday 9-11 AM EST (for Show HN)
- Tuesday/Wednesday for Reddit
- Weekday mornings for LinkedIn

**Avoid:**

- Friday afternoons
- Weekends
- Major news days
- Holiday weeks

**Remember:** The goal is honest feedback, not viral success. Better to get 10 users who find real value than 1000 who bounce immediately.
