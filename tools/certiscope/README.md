## 🌟 Overview

CertiScope AI is a sophisticated web analysis system that goes beyond traditional data collection. It combines intent recognition, multi-source verification, and certainty scoring to deliver reliable, context-aware insights from web data.

**Part of the [Adaptive Intelligence Platform](../../README.md)** - works seamlessly with other intelligence tools for comprehensive automation workflows.

---

## 🎯 What Problem Does It Solve?

In an era of information overload, it's challenging to:

- ❓ **Trust online information** without verification
- 🧠 **Understand context and intent** behind data  
- 📊 **Assess reliability** of different sources
- 🎯 **Make informed decisions** based on uncertain data

CertiScope AI addresses these challenges by providing **transparent, scored reliability** for every piece of information it analyzes.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Intent Recognition

- NLP-powered intent detection using zero-shot classification
- Automatic query optimization based on user goals
- Entity extraction (organizations, people, dates, locations)
- Multi-intent scoring with confidence levels

### 🛡️ Advanced Certainty Scoring

**Multi-dimensional reliability assessment:**

- **Source credibility** scoring (0.5 max)
- **Content quality** analysis (0.3 max)  
- **Recency evaluation** (0.2 max)
- **Cross-verification** across sources (0.3 max)
- **Sentiment consistency** (0.1 max)

Plus fact validation and claim verification with quality indicators.

### 🔍 Comprehensive Web Analysis

- Multi-source scraping (News, Reddit, Social Media, Blogs)
- Sentiment analysis with VADER and custom models

analyzer = CertiScopeAI()

# Run analysis with certainty scoring
results = analyzer.analyze_topic(
    "climate change impacts",
    intent_hint="research analysis"  # Optional
)

# Get comprehensive report with reliability scores
report = results.generate_report()
print(f"Overall certainty: {report.certainty_score}/1.0")
print(report.summary)
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Interactive mode
python -m certiscope interactive

# Direct analysis with sources
python -m certiscope analyze "AI trends" --sources news,reddit

# Batch processing
python -m certiscope batch topics.txt --output-dir ./reports
```
