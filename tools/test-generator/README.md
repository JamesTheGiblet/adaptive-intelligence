# Test Code Generator — Automated Test Creation

Stop writing tests manually. Generate comprehensive test suites instantly.

## The Problem

Testing is essential but frustrating:

- Writing tests is boring and repetitive
- Test coverage is low (developers skip tests)
- Tests are inconsistent across the codebase
