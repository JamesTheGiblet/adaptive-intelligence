# EmbedID — Code Watermarking & Provenance Protocol

Stop code plagiarism. Track authorship. Prove provenance.

## The Problem

Every day, code is copied without attribution:

- AI-generated code has no source tracking
- Open source remixes lose original attribution
- Code theft is impossible to prove
- No way to verify who wrote what
- Licensing violations go undetected

**The damage:** Lost attribution, stolen work, compliance nightmares, and destroyed trust.

## The Solution

EmbedID embeds tamper-resistant watermarks directly into your code files. Track authorship, remix lineage, and AI generation metadata—all verifiable and transparent.

## Features

- **Tamper-resistant watermarking** — Cryptographic signatures prevent forgery
- **Remix lineage tracking** — See the full history of code evolution
- **AI generation metadata** — Know what was AI-generated and by what
- **Multi-language support** — Works with Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust, and more
- **Verification tools** — Prove authorship with cryptographic proof
- **License compliance** — Track license chains through remixes
